# duk's dotfiles

Welcome to my cross-platform dots. These dotfiles focus on the following things:

* Minimal rice, but still looks nice
* More functionality
* Stability
* Better quality-of-life
* Fast as fuck

Each dotfile is managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), one of the best cross-platform dotfile managers.

I do recommend that you [familiarize yourself with chezmoi first](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/command-overview/) if you want to apply my dots using chezmoi.
